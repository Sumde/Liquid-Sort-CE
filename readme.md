### Liquid Sort CE!

In this game (for the TI-84 Plus CE calculator) you take different liquids from glasses, and move them until you are able to get all the glasses sorted with the correct liquids!

## Instructions:
Use the left and right arrow keys to change which glass to select, then press "2nd" to select a glass, and press "2nd" again on another glass to pour the liquid your selected glass into the other glass you just clicked.
